# 🗺️ Product Roadmap (Jan 17 - Jun 30, 2026) - 6-Month Comprehensive App

## Executive Summary

**Vision:** Build a professional, comprehensive digital memory archive + physical album platform for families. **NOT MVP**—full-featured product with collaborative features from day one.

**Mission:** Help families preserve, organize, and relive their children's growth stories through intuitive photo management, collaborative family features, and beautiful physical albums.

**Timeline**: 6 months (Jan 17 - Jun 30, 2026) → Full comprehensive app launch

- ✅ Collaborative family features (family members upload photos too)
- ✅ Fast, simple upload (3-step: child → photo → date+comment+tags)
- ✅ Focus on practical features, not emotional features
- ✅ Comprehensive from launch (not stripped-down MVP)

## What's NOT Included (Intentional Decisions)

```
❌ Memory Cards ("X years ago today" notifications)
   Reason: Duygu pornosu, unnecessary

❌ AI-Generated Stories
   Reason: Feels gimmicky, users want authenticity

❌ Video Support (MVP)
   Reason: Storage costs, complexity → Phase 2+

❌ Milestone Auto-Detection
   Reason: Works better with training data, Phase 2+

❌ Face Recognition (MVP)
   Reason: Privacy concerns, technical complexity → Phase 2+

❌ Comments on Photos
   Reason: Family messaging kept simple, can be Q2

✅ KEPT: Simple, practical features that add real value
